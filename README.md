## URL Shortener

### Objective

Goal: The exercise consists of building a "URL Shortener" application which converts "short codes" into URL redirects, similar to a service such as https://bitly.com/. Specifically we are interested in the candidates ability to demonstrate knowledge in using the MVC design pattern and Test-driven Development (TDD) using Laravel's integration with PHPUnit.

### Requirements

The application should allow users to register/login, and to manage (add/delete) urls that have short codes associated with them. Each user should only be able to manage their own short codes.
Short codes must be unique and should be automatically generated by the application when a user adds a url. A short code should be 5 characters in length and consist solely of upper and lower case letters (no numbers or special characters).
And finally, a guest user should be able to hit an endpoint with the short code and be redirected to the associated url. So for example: by going to http://localhost/XkJlg , the guest user of the application should be redirected to https://www.google.com

### Solution

Tried to create the project as per requirement. I used laravel-8 and sqlite database.
